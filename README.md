# SeedphrasePictogram
The Bitcoin Seedphrase Pictogram Project

## About
The goal is to have a set of freely available well suited pictograms for Bitcoin recovery seed phrases that can be used as a visual memory guide to more easily remember seed phrases.
In addition to the pictograms are dictionaries that to complement the memorization by a better understanding of the words.

## Project guidelines
### What makes a good pictogram for this purpose?
* The picture is clearly distinguishable from any other picture in the set.
* There is a two-way recognition between the picture and the word, i.e. it is possible to unambiguously go from one word in the set to one picture in the set and conversely it is possible to go from one picture in the set to one word in the set.
* It has an unencumbered license or no license at all which makes it available for any purpose.

# Status
6% of the English set has pictures.
There is an English dictionary, it contains for the project handpicked particularly fitting definitions for about half of the words.

Sources for the definitions are Wordnet OMW and Wiktionary with some manual editing.

## Word of caution
Please don't use this list to memorize important seed phrases until it reaches a level of stability.
The list is not yet complete and the pictures can change without notice.
