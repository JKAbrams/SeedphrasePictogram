### Guiding rules for definitions:
* One definition that finds the ground essence of the word in an inclusive way
* Brevity rather than pedantery, without losing too much precision
* A more tangible aspect is better than a less tanglible aspect of the words meaning. Concreteness a benefit as it leads to better integration between the pictograms and the words.
* Discourage circular definitions
* If a word have several meanings where a common essence is not what one thinks of, the most everyday recognizable meaning is used.
    For example: _drum_ can mean both a musical percussion instrument or basically anything that has a cylinder form, here the instrument is used.
